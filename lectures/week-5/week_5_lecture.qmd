## Last Week (Recap)

-  Popping List Elements
- `for` loops and `for` loops nested in Python
- `break` statement in Python
- `while` loop in Python
-  Setting Flags in Python

## This Week

- Quiz Answers
- Problem Solving using Loops
- Writing Functions 

## Problem 1 using Loops 

- Write a program to print the sum of first 10 numbers in Python.

## Answer 1 using Loops 


```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

num  = 10
sum = 0 
while num >= 1:
    sum = sum + num
    num -= 1 
print(sum)
```

## Problem 2 using Loops

- Write a program to print table of a number entered from User.

## Answer 2 using While Loops 

```{python}

#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

#i = 1
#num = int(input("Enter any number : "))
#while i <= 10:
#    print(num, "*", i, " = ", num*i)
#    i += 1

```

## Answer 2 using For Loops

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# user_input = int(input("Enter any number : "))
# for i in range(1,11):
#   table  = i * user_input
#    print(table)
```


## Problem 3 Using Loops

Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 and 50.

Note: The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....

## Problem 3 Answer

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

n1 = 0 
n2 = 1
i = 0
while i < 50:
    print(n1)
    nth_term = n1 + n2
    n1 = n2
    n2 = nth_term
    i += 1
```


## Functions

*A function is a block of Python code that robotically does the same thing again and again, whenever you invoke its name. It saves you repetitive coding and makes your code easier to understand.*


## Example

::: {.incremental}

- This code adds up two numbers.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

first_num = 2
second_num = 3 
total = first_num + second_num
print(total)
```

- How to convert it into a function? 

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

def add_numbers(a, b): 
    total = a + b
    print(total)
```

- Then we call the function

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

add_numbers(2,3)
```

## More on Functions

::: {.incremental}

- The definition begins with the keyword `def` (for define)

- Then comes the name. It can be any legal variable name you like

- `a` and `b` are know as arguments in the function

- Then these arguments are used in the function body

- The function name is followed by parentheses

- Our case the function name is add_numbers.

## Problem for Function

Q. Write a Python function named `bmi_calculator` which takes 4 arguments and then calculate BMI.

1. Name
2. Age
3. Height (m)
4. Weight (Kg)

$$
BMI = Weight (Kg) / Height (m)
$$

Output : `Name` has `BMI` with `age` years of age.
