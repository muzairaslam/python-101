## Last Week (Recap)

::: {.incremental}

- Single Line and Multile Commenting in Python.
- Taking information from user using `input()`
- Solved the BMI Problem as Lab Exercise.
- Introduced Lists
- Lists Operations : `append()`, `insert()`
- Lists Slicing
- Lists Deletion

## Last Week Recap

::: {.incremental}

- `Listname[ Initial : End : IndexJump ]`

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# Initialize list
Lst = [50, 70, 30, 20, 90, 10, 50]
 
# Slice 1
print(Lst[::])

# Slice 2
print(Lst[1:5])

# Slice 3 
print(Lst[1:5:2])

# Slice 4
print(Lst[::2])
```

:::

## Popping Elements

- Popping means to strike an element off a list but hang onto it for another purpose.

```{python}

#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

tasks = ["email Uzair", "call Ali", "meet with Zaid"]

# Pop the element from tasks to task_accomplished list

# Step 1: store the element in a variable
latest_task_accomplished = tasks.pop(1) 
print(latest_task_accomplished)

# Step 2: Create an empty list named task_accomplished_
tasks_accomplished = []

# Step 3: Append the variable to task_accomplished list
tasks_accomplished.append(latest_task_accomplished)
print(tasks_accomplished)

```

## Insertion to a known index in the list

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

tasks = ["email Uzair", "call Ali", "meet with Zaid"]

tasks_accomplished = ["call Ali"]

# Pop the second element of the tasks list
# And insert it to second element of tasks_accomplished list

tasks_accomplished.insert(2, tasks.pop(2))

print(tasks_accomplished)
```

## for Loops

- Suppose we want to check if a particular city is one of the 5 environmentally cleanest cities in the Karachi.


- You've assigned the name of the city in question to the `variable city_to_check`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

city_to_check = "Karachi"
```

- And you've assigned the names of the 5 cleanest cities to the **list** `cleanest_cities`

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

cleanest_cities = ["Lahore", "Quetta", "Hyderabad", "Karachi", "Thatta"]
```


## How to check if cleanest_cities has city_to_check ?

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

for a_clean_city in cleanest_cities:
  if city_to_check == a_clean_city:
    print("It's one of the cleanest cities")
    break
```


- Things to notice:
- Line 1 ends in a colon.
- Line 2 is indented, because it takes its orders from Line 1.
- Line 3 has a deeper indent than Line 2, because it takes its orders from Line 2.

## break statement

- In the course of comparing the city in question against the list of clean cities, if Python finds a match, there's no point in continuing the loop.

- So you stop the loop by adding a `break` statement

## Note About range()

- `range()` is a function in Python which returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

- Syntax: `range(start, stop, step)`

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

for i in range(10):
  print(i)

```


## for Loops nested

- We can also run nested loops in Python.

## Example

```{python}

#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

first_names = ["Uzair ", "Ayesha ", "Abdul ", "Ali ", "Abdullah"]
last_names = ["Aslam", "Imran", "Samad", "Imran"]
full_names = []
for a_first_name in first_names:
  for a_last_name in last_names:
    full_names.append(a_first_name + " " + a_last_name)
print(full_names)
```


- The `inner loop` runs a complete cycle of iterations on each iteration of the `outer loop`.
- The total combinations we get are 4 * 5 = 20

## While Loops

- A while loop is used to repeatedly execute the indented block of code as long as the True-False condition following the word 'while' evaluates to True.

-  It is ideal for situations where the total number of iterations necessary cannot be defined beforehand, such as obtaining user input and checking it until correct input is entered.

## Example

- Suppose you want the user to be able to check a city, 

- Then if he/she wants, check another city after that, and then another city after that, etc.

- Please open the While-loop.py file

## Setting Flags

- We can set flags like `True` and `False` in our code.
- For example see Flagged-While-loop.py

# Explanation

- Line 1 assigns True to the variable that I named keep_looping. 

- True is a special value known as a Boolean.

- Line 2 says, "As long as the variable keep_looping stays True, keep looping."

- The code inside the loop is the same as it was in the last slide.

- Lines 13 and 14 say, "If the user has entered 'q,' change the value of keep_looping to False."
