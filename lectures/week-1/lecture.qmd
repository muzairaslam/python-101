## Python Language

::: {.incremental}

- Python is a popular, 30-year-old general purpose programming language.

- Created by Guido van Rossum. 

- Compared with some other languages, it's easy to learn, and it's relatively easy to read. 

- Python is often used to teach beginners the fundamentals of programming.

## Our First Lesson : print


- `print()` tells the program to display words or numbers on the screen.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

print("Hello World")
```

- print is a keyword that has special meaning for Python. 

- It means, "Display what’s inside the parentheses."

- —"Hello, World!"—is called a text string or simply a string
