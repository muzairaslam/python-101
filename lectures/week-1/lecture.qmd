## Python Language

::: {.incremental}

- Python is a popular, 30-year-old general purpose programming language.

- Created by Guido van Rossum. 

- Compared with some other languages, it's easy to learn, and it's relatively easy to read. 

- Python is often used to teach beginners the fundamentals of programming.

:::

## Our First Lesson : print


- `print()` tells the program to display words or numbers on the screen.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

print("Hello World")
```

- print is a keyword that has special meaning for Python. 

- It means, "Display what’s inside the parentheses."

- —"Hello, World!"—is called a text string or simply a string

## Variables for Strings

- When we want to create variables in Python we store them in an object.

- I want to create variable of my name : "Uzair"

- Then I would `print()` it.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

name = "Uzair"
print(name)
```

- Always give your variables meaningful names.

## Rules for defining variables

- Each statement is on a separate line

- Variable names can't have spaces in them.

- `country of origin` is not a legal variable name.

- `country_of_origin` is a legal variable name


## Variables for Numbers

- Similar to string, we can assign variable to numbers

```{python}

#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

weight = 150
print(weight)

```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

weight + 25

```


## String cannot be added to Number

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

original_num = "23"
# new_num = original_num + 7

# The above line will give error.

```

## Math Expressions

Familiar operators in math expressions are + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), and / (divide).

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# addition

number = 4
popular_number = number + 4
print(popular_number)
```

## Subtraction

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# subtraction

number = 4
popular_number = number - 4
print(popular_number)
```

## Multiply

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# multiply

number = 4
popular_number = number * 4
print(popular_number)
```

## Divide

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# divide

number = 4
popular_number = number / 4
print(type(popular_number))
print(type(number))
print(type("Uzair"))

```
