## Last Week (Recap)

::: {.incremental}

- Introduced Floor Division in Python `//`
- Introduced Modulo Operator `%`
- We covered order of precedence. 
- We also saw how to test conditions in Python using: 
`if`, `elif`, `else` and nested conditions.
- Quick Quiz: What does `%` do in Python ?
- Quick Quiz: What is the order of precedence in Python ?

## This Week

::: {.incremental}

- Commenting in Python
- Getting Information from User
- Our First Python Data Structure: **Lists**

:::

## Comments in Python

::: {.incremental}

- **Comments** are lines of text in your code that Python ignores.
- Comments are for the human, not the machine. For example, a comment can explain a section of code so another programmer can understand it.
- A comment can help you figure out your code when you come back to it a month
or a year later.
- To write comment a line in Python we use: `#` at the beginning of line.

:::

## Example 1 

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# This is a comment.
# This is another comment.
# Python ignores these comments.
# The code that Python executes is next, on line

print("Hello, world!")
```

## Example 2: Multi line Comment


```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

'''
This is a comment.
This is another comment.
Python ignores these comments.
The code that Python executes is next, on line
'''
print("Hello World!")

```


## Getting information from the user

::: {.incremental}

- Some times we will need to take input from the user in the code.
- The user will enter the data and our code will run on the input.
- To get user input in Python we use `input` function.

## Examples

Check `user-input-demo.py` for examples

## Solve in Jupyter Notebook or .py 

Q. Write a Python code which takes four inputs from user: 

1. Name
2. Age
3. Height (m)
4. Weight (Kg)

Then calculate the BMI of the person. The BMI is calculated as 

$$
BMI = Weight (Kg) / Height (m)
$$

**Print the following in Python:**

`Name` has `BMI` with `age` years of age.
