# Week-3 Input Lecture

# Take user age as input 
#user_age = input("What is your age ? ")

# Print the age
#print("User age is " + user_age)

# Check the type of user_age
#print(type(user_age))

# Perform some calculation on user_age
#double_user_age = int(user_age) * 2

# Print the calculation
#print(double_user_age)

# Check the type of double_user_age
#print(type(double_user_age))

# convert integer data type to string
#str_double_age = str(double_user_age)

# now see the data type 
#print(type(str_double_age))

y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Copy the numbers 2 through 4 out of y and assign the slice to x.

x = y[1:4]
print(x)
