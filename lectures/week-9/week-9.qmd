## Some Announcements

- Assignment 2 Problems Discussion
- Discussion of Project Ideas


## Last Week

- Removing items from dictionary
- looping through values
- looping through keys
- looping through key value pairs
- Creating list of dictionaries
- Picking information out of a list of dictionaries

## This Week

- Working with Data files
- Reading, Writing and Appending data
- Creating directory using `os` package
- Exception Handling
- Working in Pandas using csv and excel files




## Writing data in files

- In all the coding so far in this book, none of the data has been preserved. 

- We created variables, lists, dictionaries, that contained information, but as soon as the computer was turned off, all of it disappeared.

- Now we will learn how to store the information in the file.


## Opening and Storing data file

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

greetings = "Hello, world!"
with open("example_file.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(greetings)
```

- `as` is a keyword meaning that you're assigning a file handle to the file.
- `with` tells Python to close the file after you write to it

## Retrieving data

- We have created a text file, `example_file.txt`. Its entire contents: the string "Hello world!""

- How do we retrieve it? 

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

with open("example_file.txt", "r") as f:
    text_file_content = f.read()
print(text_file_content)
```

- We specify `"r"` for "read" instead of `"w"` for "write."

## Appending data

- I want to write more data in the file.
- The text I want to append is `"Have a nice day!"`

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

with open("example_file.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("\nHave a nice day!")
```

- `\n` is the new-line character

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

with open("example_file.txt") as f:
    message = f.read()
    print(message)
```
